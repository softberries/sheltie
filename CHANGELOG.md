## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton: Cargo workspace with crate stubs, CI, lint and dependency policy, community files.
- Design document, issue backlog, playground setup and post-v1 roadmap in `docs/`.
- `sheltie-core`: identifier newtypes, `Footprint` and the conflict `Relation`.
- `sheltie-core`: `Change` with its `ChangeState` lifecycle, `Verification`, `Resolution` with
  `ResolutionTier`, `HeadEvent` with `GuaranteeTier`, validated git object ids and `Score`.
- `sheltie-store`: initial Postgres schema (changes, footprints, verifications, resolutions,
  head events) with embedded sqlx migrations.
- `sheltie-server`: starts from `DATABASE_URL` / `SHELTIE_BIND`, applies migrations on startup,
  serves `GET /healthz`, and shuts down gracefully on Ctrl-C or SIGTERM.

### Changed

- MSRV raised from 1.85 to 1.94, required by sqlx 0.9.
